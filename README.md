Problem Statement

Five-card draw is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards, 
is then allowed to swap any number of those cards for new ones, 
and then competes against each other based on the standard 5 card poker hand strength.

You need to design and develop a console based application which will deal and  evaluate  
poker  hands  for  a  simplified  version  of  the  five-card  draw variant.  
Like  the five-card  draw variant,  the  application  will  have  to  deal  a  hand  of  5  cards,  
but  unlike  the  five-card  draw  variant,  no swapping will be allowed. 

The application will be required to provide the following functionality:

    ▪Simulate shuffling a standard deck of 52 cards.
    ▪Deal a single hand of 5 cards to the player.
    ▪Evaluate the player’s hand, informing them of the highest ranked poker handthat matches their hand of 5 cards.
    
The standard 5 card poker hand strength applies.
 
Listed in decreasing rank, these hands are:

    1.Straight Flush
    2.Four of a Kind
    3.Full House
    4.Flush
    5.Straight
    6.Three of a Kind
    7.Two Pair
    8.One Pair
    9.High Cards
    
Technical Requirements :

    ▪The application is to be developed as a console application in any object-orientated programming 
        language you feel comfortable with. 
    ▪You should include a build script which can compile, package and run the application. 
    ▪The application code should alsobe properly unit tested, 
        and the build script should be able to run the unit tests.

# To Run
Simply execute run.cmd or run.sh from the root directory.

Prerequisites :
    
    ▪Maven installed and available on the path
    ▪java installed and available on the path
